# topic-modelling-speeches
At the beginning of each calendar year, the president of the United States delivers a State of the Union Speech to congress. SOTUS act as useful placeholders for events in time, as they mostly document contemporary events. As such, SOTUS are a useful dataset for discovering what topics are central to the American ideology/ethos, over time.  This investigation concerns an exploratory topic model analysis of SOTUS; from 1914 to 2009. My hypothesis is twofold: firstly, what topics appear central to American discourse, and secondly—as this is a predominantly exploratory exercise—is topic modelling a useful tool for discourse analysis, specifically, and Digital Humanities research, broadly?
